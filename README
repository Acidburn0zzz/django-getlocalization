Django-GetLocalization Module User Manual


Here are the steps you need to take the Django-GetLocalization Module into use.

1) Download the whole zip file, unzip it and rename it to django-getlocalization to the root folder of your project.

2) Register a new project at http://www.getlocalization.com.

3) Add the following configuration variables in project settings.py file:

GL_USERNAME : Get Localization username
GL_PASSWORD : Get Localization password
GL_PROJECT_URL : Project URL on GetLocalization, the common form is http://getlocalization.com/XXX/ where XXX is the project name
GL_MASTER_CODE (OPTIONAL) : The IANA code for master language, default is ‘en’

4) Add "django-getlocalization" into your installed apps
5) Run "python manage.py syncgl".

The command finds all localization files (.po files) in LC_MESSAGES folders in all project sub-folders and uploads them directly to Get Localization. Then fetches all translation files from Get Localization and automatically updates the language folders.

Finally, the command automatically runs "django-admin.py compilemessages" to generate the message files ready to be used.
