Django-GetLocalization Module Quick Guide


Here are the five steps you need to complete to take the Django-GetLocalization Module into use.

1) Download the whole zip file and unzip it

2) Open the unzipped folder and run "python setup.py install"

3) Register a new project at http://www.getlocalization.com.

4) Add the following configuration variables in project settings.py file:

GL_USERNAME : Get Localization username
GL_PASSWORD : Get Localization password
GL_PROJECT_URL : Project URL on GetLocalization, the common form is "https://getlocalization.com/XXX/" where XXX is the project name
GL_MASTER_CODE (OPTIONAL) : The IANA code for master language, default is "en"

* Note that, the project URL must use HTTPS ... 

Add "glsync" into your installed apps

5) Run "python manage.py syncgl".

This command finds all localization files (.po files) in LC_MESSAGES folders in all project sub-folders and uploads them directly to Get Localization. Then it fetches all translation files from Get Localization and automatically updates the language folders.

Finally, the command automatically runs "django-admin.py compilemessages" to generate the message files ready to be used.
