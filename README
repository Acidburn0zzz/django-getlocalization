Django-Getlocalization is a Django module to help synchronizing the localization files between Django applications 
and Get Localization, the localization platform for developers. Synchronization will be simpler and easier than ever before, 
as you manage localization conveniently from the command line. Without any hassle, and no emails needing to be sent.
Django-GetLocalization Module Quick Guide

Please complete the following simple steps to take the Django-GetLocalization Module into use:

1) Download the zip file and extract the files.

2) Open the extracted folder and run "python setup.py install".

3) Register a new project at http://www.getlocalization.com.

4) Add the following configuration variables to project settings.py file:

GL_USERNAME : Get Localization username
GL_PASSWORD : Get Localization password
GL_PROJECT_URL : Project URL on GetLocalization, the common form is "https://getlocalization.com/XXX/" where XXX is the project name
GL_MASTER_CODE (OPTIONAL) : The IANA code for master language, default is "en"

* Please note that the project URL must use HTTPS.

5) Add "syncgl" to your installed applications.

6) Run "python manage.py syncgl".

This command finds all localization files (.po files) in LC_MESSAGES folders in all project sub-folders and uploads them directly to Get Localization. Then it fetches all translation files from Get Localization and automatically updates the language folders.

Finally, the command automatically runs "django-admin.py compilemessages" to generate the message files ready to be used.
